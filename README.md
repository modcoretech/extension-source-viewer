# Extension Source Viewer

**Extension Source Viewer** is a web-based tool for examining the source code of Chrome extensions. By uploading a `.crx` file, you can view its extracted contents directly in your browser. All processing takes place locally on your device; no data is transmitted to any server.

This tool is part of the **modcore** ecosystem and is optimized for use with the **modcore Extension Manager**, which provides the “Get CRX of this extension” feature for downloading CRX files from the Chrome Web Store.
